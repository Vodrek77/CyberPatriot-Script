# CyberPatriot-Script
THIS CANNOT BE USED BY ANYONE OTHER THAN THE CREATOR FOR CYBERPATRIOT COMPETITIONS AS PER THE RULES.

A CyberPatriot Script for Ubuntu/Debian Images, written with Bash.

This is a fundamental script, and continuously in the process of being worked on and improved, currently, there are these commands:

1) Manage Users - Adds/Removes unauthorized users and admins in the system. Also, changes users passwords to strong ones.
2) Manage Groups - Add and delete groups as well as adding/removing users from groups with user input
3) Password Policy - Strengthens password policies (login.defs, pam.d files) and creates backups in case of emergency
4) Activate Firewall - Installs and activates UFW
5) Configure Auditd - Installs and activates Auditd
6) Scan Crontab - Scans the system for Crontab files and allows user interaction with them
7) Processes and Services - Shows all processes and services (IN PROGRESS OF BEING REDONE)
8) Automatic Update - Configures automatic update settings without GUI input
9) Full Update - Fully updates the system in a seperate terminal, allowing the user to continue to use their own while in progress
10) Restore Backup - Restores backup files (if found) to serve as a failsafe in case of something breaking

As I continue to work on this script, I will continue to update it with more functionality!
