# CyberPatriot-Script
THIS CANNOT BE USED BY ANYONE OTHER THAN THE CREATOR FOR CYBERPATRIOT COMPETITIONS AS PER THE RULES.

A CyberPatriot Script for Ubuntu/Debian Images, written with Bash.

This is a fundamental script, and continuously in the process of being improved. As of this point, there are 10 built in functionalities to choose from.
These are:

1. Activate Multiple
2. Manage Users - NOT DONE
3. Manage Groups - NOT DONE
4. Activate Firewall
5. Full Update
6. Configure PAM - NOT DONE
7. Fix Root Login
8. Configure Auditd
9. Scan Crontab
10. Processes and Services

As I continue to work on this script, I will continue to update it with more functionality.
